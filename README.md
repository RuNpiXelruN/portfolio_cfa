### Predicted site audience

For my personal portfolio site the audience will range from being prospective employers, potential partners, and friends and family. It is therefore important that the site demonstrates the following:
  * a competent level of coding skill
  * a broad range of features and techniques used
  * a design spec that is aligned with current trends
  * and a refection of my personality and who I am


### Design decisions

After initial concepting I decided I'd like my portfolio be fun, and to be different from the portfolio sites that I had seen to date. I wanted to be creative and create some elements of the site from scratch. I came up with the title 'web-dev/superhero' and it kind of stuck. This set me down the path of illustrating assets that I would later use in the site. The site contains some superhero illustrations on a couple of pages but also incorporates an element of evil, because what's the point of having a superhero if there's no bad guys for him to take down. 

It would have been relatively easy for me to create a 'one page scroll' website for each or all pages, as I have created one in the past however, I didn't feel I had much to gain and instead wanted to challenge myself and build a website in a way I hadn't before. I decided to build each section as one page and transition through those pages as the user navigates through the site. This came with the advantage of creating an extremely quick and smooth user experience as there was no need for new page loading however, also came with lots of challenges. The main challenge being the ability of the site to keep track of each page position at any point in time and be ready to slide it into view should the user choose to see it. This was a challenge but a great experience as my knowledge of jquery and it's mechanics have now improved greatly. I did however build the site as a 'one page scroll' for it's mobile version as I felt this would create a more pleasing user experience than having to transition pages on mobile. Throughout the site I used a variety of techniques to display my skillset. Lots of jQuery interactions and event handling, CSS animations and transitions, sprite sheets for Social Icons and simple HTML5 validations for my form fields. All code was written from scratch, and made responsive by myself. Bootstrap was used for dismissable success alerts only. Partly due to their ease of implementation and being able to dismiss them, and also for usability heuristic reasons, as they are widely used and familiar. Another way in which I considered usability heuristics when designing my site was the minimalistic nature of the pages. I took a lot of care in making the pages clean and uncluttered. The use of HTML5 form-field validation is another example of usability heuristic consideration. Users are learn of form errors before submission of the form, allowing them the ability to correct errors on the same page, as opposed to reloading a page and finding out after the fact. On pages that are able to be directly scrolled from left to right, big clear arrows are placed on the left and right edges of the page as this is a common position for page arrows. A home icon was used in the navigation tab as opposed to the word 'home' as the icon is a familiar addition to most websites.
